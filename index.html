        Introduction to Hemophilia A
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder that significantly affects the blood's ability to clot properly, leading to excessive bleeding even from minor injuries. This condition primarily affects males and is due to deficiencies in Factor VIII, a crucial protein in the blood clotting process. Understanding Hemophilia A is vital for managing symptoms effectively and improving the quality of life for those affected.

        Understanding Hemophilia A
    </h2>
    <p>
        Factor VIII plays a pivotal role in the blood clotting cascade, and its deficiency leads to Hemophilia A. Unlike Hemophilia B, which involves a deficiency in Factor IX, Hemophilia A is more common and varies in severity depending on the level of Factor VIII activity. Symptoms can range from spontaneous bleeding episodes to prolonged bleeding after injuries or surgery. Diagnosis involves a series of blood tests to measure the clotting ability and Factor VIII levels.

    <h2>
        Current Treatments and Innovations
    </h2>
    <p>
        The treatment landscape for Hemophilia A has evolved significantly, with strategies focusing on replacing the missing Factor VIII through infusions of clotting factor concentrates. Advances in genetic engineering have led to the development of recombinant factor products and novel treatments like gene therapy, aiming for a long-term solution to this condition. Among these innovations, Refacto, Elocta, and Hemlibra stand out for their unique approaches to managing Hemophilia A, each offering specific benefits that will be explored in detail on the following pages.
